# IPFS Cluster workshops

IPFS Cluster workshops are small courses that we run to teach how to use IPFS
Cluster. We usually have everyone run a cluster peer to form a cluster with
the rest of participants. Then we explain how to add, pin and check the status
of items in the pinset.

Sometimes the workshop is accompanied by a presentation on how to setup and
administer an IPFS Cluster deployment.
